# Short-term TODO list: 

## Downscaling -- module-B

* Incorporate country-region mapping for each model. For GCAM, the model downscale GCAM emissions at GCAM native regions. What region level should be used for other models? (native or aggregated)

## Gridding -- module-C 

* discuss output format -- NetCDF with what structure?
